I'm a Front-end Developer Forever GM who moonlights [making modules](https://www.foundryvtt-hub.com/packages/?_sfm_author=Andrew%20Krigline) and contributing to the Foundry developer ecosystem.

## Projects

> ### [Foundry VTT Module Making for Beginners](https://hackmd.io/@akrigline/ByHFgUZ6u)
> A module making tutorial for beginners. This covers everything from "I have no files" to "I have a module which interacts with Flags, Settings, FormApplication, CSS, Localization, Hooks, and more."

> ### [Foundry Community Wiki Development API Section](https://foundryvtt.wiki/en/development/api)
> A labor of love to provide a standardized and thorough examination of the most commonly used parts of the Foundry VTT public API.
